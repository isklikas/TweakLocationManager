# TweakLocationManager

Do you want to get the location of your iOS device from a tweak, without having to deal with permissions? Well, just copy - paste this code.
The entire logic is explained in the [Tweak.x](Tweak.x) file.

P.S. As an advice. **Use this code as a _snippet_**. I tried moving it inside a method that returns a `CLLocation *` object and it would always fail then. By all means, if you get this working inside a `CLLocation *` returning method, or you improve my approach, feel free to fork my work and maybe, pull request it? :)
